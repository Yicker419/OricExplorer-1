# Original Author's Notes on the status of Oric Explorer

## Email from Scott Davies on 23 April 2018

> Hi Laurent,
>
> Thank-you for your enquiry regarding Oric Explorer. I've had a number of enquires this year of the same nature so it's probably time I let people know the current situation regarding any new versions.
>
> The version that was online was uploaded by mistake and was probably more of a V1.5 than a V2.0. I took it down once I realized that it was available however by that time some people had downloaded it.
>
> The development of Oric Explorer V2.0 has been on hold for sometime now, due to family and work commitments I just don't have the time to do any development other than little bits here and there. Because of this I've been thinking for some time now about releasing the source code to the Oric community to see if anyone would like to take on development so your enquiry has finally made that decision for me.
>
> I'm more that happy to email you the full project source code along with an executable for V2.0 as it stands at the moment or upload it somewhere. This would prevent the development of Oric Explorer coming to a complete halt if someone was to carry on development.
>
> There are a number of things to note.
>
> - The code has been developed in C# using Visual Studio 2015/2017.
> - It requires the .Net V4.5.2 framework to be installed.
> - The code is not the best code in the world so may be difficult to follow in some areas.
> - Likewise some areas are not extensively commented other areas are not commented at all.
> - The project includes an installation script that uses the NullSoft installation application (not fully tested).
> - The code is far from complete and therefore will certainly contain bugs as well as incomplete features.
> - The main thing that is missing is code to write to .dsk files.
> - The 'FormsControlLibrary.dll' is a one that I have written (source code available on request), all the other dll's are third-party ones.
> - There is currently no readme file or help text but installation can be done simply by copying the bin/Release directory to wherever you want it.
>
> I think that's it for now, there is one thing I would ask, if anyone does decide to take on development, that they could make a reference to myself as the original author in the About information, if that's okay.
>
> If you could let me know where I could upload it too then Iâ€™ll do that asap.
>
> If you need any further information or details then please don't hesitate to get in touch and I will help as much as I can.
>
> Regards
